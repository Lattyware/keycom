A script which allows you to automatically log in with Keycom (an ISP that require a browser based login, common at university halls of residence).

To use, extract, edit the details in the script (probably just username and password unless you know what you are doing), add to cron (crontab -e) and leave to log you in automatically.

Currently only tested under Linux. Should work fine under other OSs, but you'd need some cron alternative.
